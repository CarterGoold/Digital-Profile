    </center>

    <center>
        <p> My name is Carter Goold, I was born and raised in London, Ontario, and raised in St. Thomas, Ontario. I am
            currently 16 as of 04/13/23, and I was born on March 20th, 2007. On my free time, I enjoy hanging out with
            my friends, and playing video games. And my favourite hobby is playing and studying chess on my free time. I
            have a sister and a step-brother, 4 cats, and 2 dogs. Outside of school, I enjoy playing online chess,
            aswell as playing against chess club members, I also like to participate in chess tournaments frequently.
            During my working career, so far I've had the pleasure of working at Sean O'Connors Plumbing Company as a
            tool upkeeper, and shop assistant. I also have lots of volunteer experience outside of paid work such as:
            Campaigning during elections, volunteering at local festivals, volunteering at cat shelters around St.
            Thomas, and working for my friends and family around school hours. I have lots of experience with
            technology, and I am very well versed in coding and computing science and technology. after highschool I
            plan to persue a career in Software Engineering and Computer Science, aswell as Computer Software Coding.
            I'd also like to dable in the trades possibly, by doing a cooperative education with an electrical company
            throughout the rest of my highschool career. I am also decently well versed in marketing and social media
            algorithms. And one day I dream of becoming a Grandmaster in Chess. Though it may take a lot of dedication,
            im willing to take the time, and money to invest in a chess career.
